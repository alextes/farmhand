## Ideas

- Simple APY is an extrapolation of earnings since start. In other words, take the value at t=0, take the value at t=now, and draw a line through both points to t=1y. We probably get a more accurate prediction by including data of each days value, i.e. a trend line.

## CoinGecko API Use

We use `/coins/list` to figure out CoinGecko coin IDs.
We use `/simple/price` to get a token price.
We use `/coins/{id}/market_chart` to get percent changes in price over arbitrary periods.

## Caching

We'd like to not hit the CoinGecko API for every requested price. We therefore implement the following caching strategies.

- The full list of tickers is cached for 24 hours.
- A simple price is cached for 60 minutes.
- A historic price is cached indefinitely.
